# Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard.

Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard,

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a game of chance that expands the traditional game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It is first used to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV between Sheldon and Raj in "The Lizard-Spock Expansion".

## Rules:
The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.

Almost always, the boys will all pick Spock at the same time and tie over and over again.
