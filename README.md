# Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard ‚õ∞Ô∏è‚úÇÔ∏èüßªüññü¶é:

Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard,

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a game of chance that expands the traditional game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. It is first used to settle a dispute about what to watch on TV between Sheldon and Raj in "The Lizard-Spock Expansion". 
The. Big. Bang. Theory.


## Rules:
The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.

Almost always, the boys will all pick Spock at the same time and tie over and over again.

Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
(and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors


## Game
This game was a suggetion from mentor as to test the knowledge achieved in project two  and practicing coding with Java script.
I also want to thank Mr Wes Bos , Pavel Soldatov,  for his tutorials about keydown/keyup events. His solution is what I used in this project for key presses, albeit with some modifications.
